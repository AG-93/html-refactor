## Horiseon landing page html-refactor


## Description

Code-refactor div to html5 lang of Horiseon's landing page so the code content can be clearly defined making it easily accessible to other collaborators, users and/or the client themselves.

I've learnt to be comfortable with html semantics and to distinguish the difference between non semantic elements: div , span and semantic elements: aside, article, main,header, footer and many more. I've also learnt the advantages of 'class' and 'id'. It can help to shorten the css stylesheet by finding patterns of the same styles by using class.

My challenge was to understand how the changes made on html affects css stylesheet and figuring out what to amend. Patience and attention to detail is required especially if it's a long script.
